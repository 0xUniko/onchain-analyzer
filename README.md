# This is my endeavour to explore on chain transactions

## Most useful parts of this repo are the util functions

This is a failed endeavour to analyzing the tokens recently listed on pcs. The conclusion is that it is hard to find the moment to buy and sell. For a good token you can earn money from buying it as soon as the token is available. However you can determine that the token is good only if you see the data a short period of time after it is available. The key is ehat we don't know what kind of man s/he is who owns the token and what s/he wants to do.

And, the volume is too small. It is unworthy.

But some util functions are still useful.
